Welcome to the Afentic AI Agents repository! This project showcases the design, implementation, and operational details of intelligent agents built using LangGraph and LlamaIndex.

ðŸš€ Core Highlights:

Agentic Workflow with LangGraph: Construct dynamic, multi-step reasoning agents using LangGraph to manage decision flows, memory, and tool orchestration.

Contextual Intelligence with LlamaIndex: Seamlessly index and query structured and unstructured data sources, enabling powerful retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Modular Architecture: Clean, extensible codebase designed for easy experimentation, integration, and scaling of new agent behaviors and tools.

Documentation & Demos: Includes step-by-step implementation guides, configuration examples, and usage demos for rapid understanding and onboarding.

ðŸ’¡ Whether you're building enterprise copilots, research assistants, or workflow-automation agents, this repository provides a solid foundation to kickstart your projects.
